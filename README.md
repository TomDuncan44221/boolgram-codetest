# Tom's Readme

Hey! Thanks for the invite to create this! 

As a forewarning, I checked on a hunch if I could locate the repo for this to acquire the assests for use - https://github.com/Danilo91Colloca/boolgram

I definitely could find it!  - You may wish to consider making more of this private or just making the assets public facing
 (unless part of the test is to see how strong my google-fu is)
 Don't worry, I didn't go exploring beyond the assets folder in case there was an answer sheet or something

// Notes

- I chose JS because I wrote this in a rush due to time constraints, as much as I love typing and it pains me to use JS - meeting the 'deadline' came first. 
- I've opted to use Materiel UI as I'm most familiar with it
- The skeleton is implemented but I didn't have enough spare time to tweak it to match the appearance, sorry! 
- I wasn't sure if the goal was to identically replicate or produce your own flair, so I went with my own flair.
- I'm sure there are even more ways to make my code more reusable but I've got a deadline to meet - I'd like to breakdown posts into a few more components
- I am constantly sad that I want to put more time into this but really shouldn't
- Please be kind!

Below is the create-react-app guff, enjoy!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
